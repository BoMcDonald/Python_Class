# Course: CIS245-T302-T801
# Assignment Number: Final Project 
# Description:  For your class project we will be creating an application that interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data.  
#		            Your program will use all of the information youâ€™ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.
#		            Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from openweathermap.org.  
#		            Your program must display the weather information in an READABLE format to the user.
