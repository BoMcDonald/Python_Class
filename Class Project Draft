# Assignment Number: Class Project Task 2
# Description:  For your class project we will be creating an application that interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data.  
		Your program will use all of the information youâ€™ve learned in the class in order to create a useful application.
		Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from openweathermap.org.  
		Your program must display the weather information in an READABLE format to the user.
		
# Start

# import requests 
import requests 

# Display welcome message
print("Welcome to the Weather Reporting Service brought to you by Python. Please press Enter to begin.")

# Define all webservice data
