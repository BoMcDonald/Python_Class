# Assignment Number: Assignment 9.1 
# Description: This week we will create a program that performs file processing activities.  Your program this week will use the OS library in order to validate that a directory 
#              exists before creating a file in that directory.  Your program will prompt the user for the directory they would like to save the file in as well as the name of the
#              file.  The program should then prompt the user for their name, address, and phone number.  Your program will write this data to a comma separated line in a file and
#              store the file in the directory specified by the user. 
#              Once the data has been written your program should read the file you just wrote to the file system and display the file contents to the user for validation
#              purposes. 



# Import OS
import os

# Define main()
def main():
  # Set directory 
  directory = input("Enter the preferred directory to save your file in: ")
  
  # Set fileName
  fileName = input("Enter the file name: ")
  
  # Set the person's name
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  
  # Set their home address
  address = input("Please enter your home address: ")
  
  # Set their phone number
  phoneNumber = input("Please enter your phone number: ")
  
  # Making sure the directory exists
  if os.path.isdir(directory):
	# Create and open the file with written capability
    writeFile = open(os.path.join(directory, fileName), 'w')
    
	# Make the program write the person's information onto a file
    writeFile.write(name+", "+address+", "+phoneNumber+"\n")
    
	# Close the file
    writeFile.close()
    
    print("File contents: ")
    
	# Have the program read the file for storage proof
    readFile = open(os.path.join(directory, fileName), 'r')
    
	# for statement
    for line in readFile:
	    print(line)
      
	# Close the file for reading
    readFile.close()
    
	# Create else statement
  else: 
    print("The directory requested does not exist.")
    
 # Call main function

main()
